# path-finder-algorithm
Welcome to the Path Finder project! This is a React application developed to find the shortest path between a start node and an end node on a grid, using Dijkstra's algorithm. The application allows users to set obstacles that the algorithm will navigate around to determine the optimal path.

# Features
Grid Visualization: Display a grid where users can select a start node, end node, and draw obstacles.

Dijkstra's Algorithm: Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node to the end node.

Obstacle Avoidance: Allow users to place obstacles on the grid that the algorithm will avoid while finding the shortest path.

Visualization: Visualize the algorithm's process step-by-step to understand how the shortest path is determined.

Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Dijkstra's Algorithm: Used to find the shortest path on the grid
HTML/CSS: Basic styling and structure of the application

# How to use

1. Click on Set Start Node button and click the cell on the grid to set start node , do the same for end button.
2. Hold the left click and move mouse around to draw obstacles.
3. Click on Visualize Dijkstra button to visualize algorithm.
